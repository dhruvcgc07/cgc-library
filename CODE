      <td>Understand the technical foundations, as well as the non-programming skills needed to be a successful full stack web developer. This book reveals the reasons why a truly successful full stack developer does more than write code. 
      <br>You will learn the principles of the topics needed to help a developer new to agile or full stack working―UX, project management, QA, product management, and more― all from the point of view of a developer. Covering these skills alongside the fundamentals and foundations of modern web development, rather than specifics of current technologies and frameworks (which can age quickly), all programming examples are given in the context of the web as it is in 2018.
      Although you need to feel comfortable working on code at the system, database, API, middleware or user interface level, depending on the task in hand, you also need to be able to deal with the big picture and the little details. The Full Stack Developer recognizes skills beyond the technical, and gives foundational knowledge of the wide set of skills needed in a modern software development team.

  What You'll Learn
  Plan your work including Agile vs Waterfall, tools, scrum, kanban and continuous delivery
  Translate UX into code: grids, component libraries and style guides
  Design systems and system architectures (microservices to monoliths)
  Review patterns for APIs (SOAP, AJAX, REST), defining API domains, patterns for REST APIs and more API goodness
  Study the various front-end design patterns you need to know
  Store data, what to consider for security, deployment, in production and more

      <td>Systems programming provides the foundation for the world's computation. Writing performance-sensitive code requires a programming language that puts programmers in control of how memory, processor time, and other system resources are used. The Rust systems programming language combines that control with a modern type system that catches broad classes of common mistakes, from memory management errors to data races between threads.
        <br>With this practical guide, experienced systems programmers will learn how to successfully bridge the gap between performance and safety using Rust. Jim Blandy, Jason Orendorff, and Leonora Tindall demonstrate how Rust's features put programmers in control over memory consumption and processor use by combining predictable performance with memory safety and trustworthy concurrency.
        <br>
<pre>
You'll learn:

Rust's fundamental data types and the core concepts of ownership and borrowing
How to write flexible, efficient code with traits and generics
How to write fast, multithreaded code without data races
Rust's key power tools: closures, iterators, and asynchronous programming
Collections, strings and text, input and output, macros, unsafe code, and foreign function interfaces

      <td>JavaScript lies at the heart of almost every modern web application, from social apps like Twitter to browser-based game frameworks like Phaser and Babylon. Though simple for beginners to pick up and play with, JavaScript is a flexible, complex language that you can use to build full-scale applications.
        <br>This much anticipated and thoroughly revised third edition of Eloquent JavaScript dives deep into the JavaScript language to show you how to write beautiful, effective code. It has been updated to reflect the current state of Java¬Script and web browsers and includes brand-new material on features like class notation, arrow functions, iterators, async functions, template strings, and block scope. A host of new exercises have also been added to test your skills and keep you on track.
        <br>As with previous editions, Haverbeke continues to teach through extensive examples and immerses you in code from the start, while exercises and full-chapter projects give you hands-on experience with writing your own programs. You start by learning the basic structure of the JavaScript language as well as control structures, functions, and data structures to help you write basic programs. Then you'll learn about error handling and bug fixing, modularity, and asynchronous programming before moving on to web browsers and how JavaScript is used to program them. As you build projects such as an artificial life simulation, a simple programming language, and a paint program, you'll learn how to:
    <br>
        <pre>
- Understand the essential elements of programming, including syntax, control, and data
- Organize and clarify your code with object-oriented and functional programming techniques
- Script the browser and make basic web applications

        The 2023 edition of ‘29 Years Topic-wise Solution of General Studies (Paper-I) of UPSC Civil Services Preliminary Examination’ is prepared strictly adhering to the latest syllabus. Key Features of this Book Categorization of questions according to topics Detailed explanation to the questions asked Explanation on options other than the correct one Additional information on the topics from which questions were asked Why Additional Information? UPSC never repeats its questions but touches upon the topics again from different aspects. By going through the additional information provided herein, aspirants will be able to answer other questions that could be asked from the topics in future. To comprehend in a better way the current pattern of questions which are interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary in nature. An in-depth analysis of the questions reveals that prior to 2000 the questions were straightforward; later they became interdisciplinary and for the last three years, majority of the questions are multidisciplinary in nature. For example, a question that asked about only Mughal architecture in the 90s changed to asking about Maratha architecture also in the same question, and in the past few years it has become a regular practice to ask about the geography or political conditions prevailing at that time. Therefore, the questions have become truly multidimensional. To address this, the book is segregated into different sections and 100+ topics that will enable the readers to adopt a holistic approach towards preparation. How to Read this Book Start with solving the questions asked before 2000 which were straightforward. Later move year-wise gradually and this way you will get accustomed to the pattern and changes taking place so that you can plan your study/strategy accordingly. etc
